# WP User QR Code Generation

This repo is a snippet of code to add to your Wordpress theme, or to integrate into a Plugin to auto generate a unique 8 digit (customisable) QR Code which is appended to the WP Users Rest API for use in an App etc.

This was specifically written to work with [Angular QR Code](https://github.com/monospaced/angular-qrcode), so provides no support and is just a helpful guide on how to send unique User QR Codes back to any App via WP Users Rest API.

## Requirements

Wordpress 4+

Existing Wordpress Theme / Plugin to integrate into

PHP 5.6+
